      <p>After viewing the source code in the browser, I recognize several elements such as div, body, and h1. Also, I notice that there are many script (js) tags. I'm guessing that they are links or pathways that lead to js code. Its interesting to see where they are placed in the HTML block.</p>

      <p>The comparable travel photo site is much more visually appealing. Furthermore, its much more organized. For example, it has tables of pictures organized by city and country. The one advantage mine could potentially have is a section for travel diaries or commentary to go along with the pictures.
